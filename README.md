本项目基于[tf-pose-estimation](https://github.com/ildoonet/tf-pose-estimation)并加入了LSTM，可对人体动作进行简单的识别
# TFPose

'Openpose', human pose estimation algorithm, have been implemented using Tensorflow. It also provides several variants that have some changes to the network structure for **real-time processing on the CPU or low-power embedded devices.**

**You can even run this on your macbook with a descent FPS!**

## 安装

### 依赖

需要安装以下依赖

- python3
- tensorflow 1.4.1+
- keras2
- opencv3, protobuf, python3-tk
- slidingwindow
  - https://github.com/adamrehn/slidingwindow
  - I copied from the above git repo to modify few things.

### 安装

Clone the repo and install 3rd-party libraries.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/human-motion-detection/tf-pose-estimation
$ cd tf-pose-estimation
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Build c++ library for post processing. See : https://github.com/human-motion-detection/tf-pose-estimation/tree/master/tf_pose/pafprocess
```
$ cd tf_pose/pafprocess
$ swig -python -c++ pafprocess.i && python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

### Package Install

Alternatively, you can install this repo as a shared package using pip.

```bash
$ git clone https://www.github.com/ildoonet/tf-pose-estimation
$ cd tf-openpose
$ python setup.py install  # Or, `pip install -e .`
```

## Models & Performances

See [experiments.md](./etc/experiments.md)

### Download Tensorflow Graph File(pb file)

Before running demo, you should download graph files. You can deploy this graph on your mobile or other platforms.

- cmu (trained in 656x368)
- mobilenet_thin (trained in 432x368)
- mobilenet_v2_large (trained in 432x368)
- mobilenet_v2_small (trained in 432x368)

CMU's model graphs are too large for git, so I uploaded them on an external cloud. You should download them if you want to use cmu's original model. Download scripts are provided in the model folder.

```
$ cd models/graph/cmu
$ bash download.sh
```

## 示例

### Test Inference

使用单张图片进行测试

```
$ python run_img.py --model=mobilenet_thin --resize=432x368 --image=./images/p1.jpg
```

### Realtime Webcam

```
$ python run.py --model=mobilenet_thin --resize=432x368 
```

Then you will see the realtime webcam screen with estimated poses as below. This [Realtime Result](./etcs/openpose_macbook13_mobilenet2.gif) was recored on macbook pro 13" with 3.1Ghz Dual-Core CPU.

## Python用法

This pose estimator provides simple python classes that you can use in your applications.

See [run.py](run.py) or [run_img.py](run_img.py) as references.

```python
e = TfPoseEstimator(get_graph_path(args.model), target_size=(w, h))
humans = e.inference(image)
image = TfPoseEstimator.draw_humans(image, humans, imgcopy=False)
```

If you installed it as a package,

```python
import tf_pose
coco_style = tf_pose.infer(image_path)
```
